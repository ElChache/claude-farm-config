# Product Clarifications - Release 1.0

## Strategic Questions for Human Project Owner

<question id="1" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the beta user whitelist (50-100 users), what's the target user profile? Tech-savvy individuals who will provide quality feedback, or a broader consumer segment to test market fit? This affects onboarding complexity and feature priorities.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Broader consumer segment to test market fit. We want to validate the product with real users, not just tech-savvy early adopters. Focus on intuitive UX and clear onboarding that any consumer can follow.</text>

<question id="2" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For monitor evaluation frequency, should users have control over how often monitors are checked (hourly, daily, etc.) or should this be purely AI-determined based on monitor type? User control adds complexity but increases satisfaction.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Yes, users should be able to override frequency. Start with AI-recommended defaults but allow user control. Maximum frequency should be hourly (to prevent abuse/costs). Options: hourly, every 6 hours, daily, weekly.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="3" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the "unlimited monitors" policy, should there be soft limits to encourage quality over quantity? For example, a warning at 50 monitors or asking users to confirm when creating their 10th monitor to avoid spam/low-quality monitors?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>For the first review/beta, let's actually limit it to 5 monitors per user. Just to be safe and ensure quality usage during testing.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="4" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For email notifications, what level of customization should users have? Just on/off per monitor, or more granular controls like notification frequency (immediate, daily digest, weekly summary)?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Email notification is an action triggered by a monitor state change. It's just the first type of action we're implementing. It's not an on/off per monitor - users must explicitly add the email action as a trigger and choose what type of state change triggers it (active->inactive, inactive->active, etc).</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="5" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the monitor creation UX, should there be monitor templates/examples for common use cases (stock tracking, weather, etc.) to help users get started quickly, or keep it completely open-ended?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Yes absolutely! That's a great idea - templates would add a lot of value to the product. You should reflect that in your project specification. Great suggestion! Include common templates like stock tracking, weather monitoring, sports events, etc.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="6" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the portal/app separation, should users be able to manage monitors directly from the portal, or is the portal purely for authentication and all functionality lives in app.domain.com?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>The portal is purely for authentication and marketing - it should actually be a nice looking website that showcases the product. All functionality lives in app.domain.com.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="7" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For data privacy, how long should historical monitor data be retained? Forever for the user's benefit, or should there be retention limits for performance/storage reasons? This affects the historical change detection feature significantly.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>A very long period, like years or so - something that doesn't affect usability but doesn't increase storage costs unreasonably. Focus on efficient storage and archival strategies.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="8" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the AI provider abstraction, what's the fallback strategy if both Claude and ChatGPT are unavailable? Queue monitors for later, show error messages, or have a third backup provider?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Queues and DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) - implement proper queuing system to handle outages gracefully and retry failed evaluations.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="9" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For user onboarding, what's the primary value proposition we want users to immediately understand? Is it "monitoring made simple" or "AI-powered personal assistant" or something else? This affects the entire first-time user experience.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>AI-powered personal assistant for monitoring anything in the real world. Focus on the AI intelligence and personal automation aspects.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="10" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For monitor sharing/collaboration, should Release 1.0 include any sharing features (read-only sharing, public monitors) or is this purely individual/private for now?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Let's leave that for Release 2.0. Keep Release 1.0 focused on individual/private monitoring to nail the core experience first.</text>
