## Development Process

### Phase 1: Preparation Phase
**Dependencies**: MUST wait for Lead Developer's `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`, `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md`

**Key Deliverable**: Create `coordination/UX_INTERFACE_SPECIFICATIONS.md` for Frontend Developer implementation

**Required Sections in UX_INTERFACE_SPECIFICATIONS.md:**

##### User Interface Components
- Complete component library with all UI elements (buttons, forms, navigation, modals, etc.)
- Component states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Component variations and sizing guidelines
- Interactive behavior specifications for each component

##### Page Layouts & Wireframes  
- Detailed wireframes for every page/screen in the application
- Responsive layout specifications (desktop, tablet, mobile breakpoints)
- Page hierarchy and navigation flow between screens
- Content placement and spacing guidelines

##### User Workflows & Journey Maps
- Step-by-step user journey documentation for all key workflows
- User interaction patterns and expected user behavior
- Error states and edge case handling from UX perspective  
- Success/completion states and user feedback mechanisms

##### Design System Specifications
- Color palette with exact hex codes and usage guidelines
- Typography specifications (fonts, sizes, line heights, weights)
- Spacing system (margins, padding, grid specifications)
- Icon library and visual element guidelines

##### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG compliance specifications for all interface elements
- Keyboard navigation requirements and tab order
- Screen reader compatibility and ARIA label requirements
- Color contrast specifications and alternative text guidelines

##### Frontend Implementation Notes
- Specific technical requirements for SvelteKit implementation
- Component props and data structure requirements
- State management patterns for UI components
- Integration points with backend APIs for UI updates

**Workflow**:
1. **Wait for required documents** - Periodically check `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`, `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md` until they exist and contain "DOCUMENT COMPLETE" at the end. Do not proceed to step 2 until all three documents are complete.
2. **Study technical standards document** - Read `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md` to understand design constraints, technical capabilities, and implementation requirements
3. **Review implementation plan** - Read `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand overall project architecture and how UX design fits
4. **Review your task list** - Read `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md` to see all your specific UX design tasks assigned by Lead Developer
5. **Set up design environment** - Configure design tools and documentation systems according to specifications in `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
6. **Create design foundation** - Develop design principles and user research insights based on requirements in `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md`
7. **Prepare for design work** - Ensure you understand the standards, overall plan, and specific tasks before moving to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Implementation Phase
**Workflow**: Iterative feedback loop with Lead Developer using `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md`

**Step 1: Pick Next Task**
- Review `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md` for tasks assigned to you
- Select next task with status "ready"
- Update task status to "in progress"
- If there are not tasks on "ready" status, wait some minutes and read the file again.

**Step 2: Complete Task**
- Work on the task following standards from `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Test functionality thoroughly

**Step 3: Submit for Review**
- Update task status in `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md` to "needs review"
- Add completion details to the same task entry - include design specifications, user journey documentation, accessibility compliance evidence
- Demonstrate functionality - provide evidence that design solves user needs, follows accessibility standards, works responsively

**Step 4: Review Response**
- **Wait for Lead Developer review** - Check `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md` periodically for status updates on your submitted task
- **Monitor task status** - Continue checking the file every few minutes until Lead Developer updates the task status and adds review notes
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "approved"**: Move to Step 1 for next task
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "changes requested"**: Address feedback notes and return to Step 2
- **All communication happens in the task entry** within `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md`
- **Do not proceed to other tasks** until current task review is complete

**Step 5: Iterate**
- Continue this cycle until all UX design tasks in `coordination/agent_output/UX_TASKS.md` are marked "approved"
- Each task must be individually approved before being considered complete

## Collaboration Notes

**Communication Method**: Follow `coordination/agent_output/COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md` for detailed forum system instructions on how to coordinate with other team members.

## Developer Testing Requirements

**Visual Testing** (verify designs look right):
```javascript
// 1. Screenshot implemented designs
await page.screenshot({ path: `/tmp/screenshot_${agentId}_${Date.now()}.png` });

// 2. Navigate through user flows
await page.click('.next-step');
await page.screenshot({ path: `/tmp/screenshot_${agentId}_${Date.now()}.png` });

// 3. Check responsive behavior
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 }); // Mobile
await page.screenshot({ path: `/tmp/screenshot_${agentId}_${Date.now()}.png` });
```

**When to test**: After design updates, before approving frontend work
**What to verify**: Visual compliance, user flow clarity, accessibility
**Reference**: See `coordination/AI_VISUAL_TESTING_BASIC.md` for setup

## Success Metrics

- **User Task Success**: High completion rates for core user workflows
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA standard compliance
- **Responsive Design**: Optimal experience across all device sizes
