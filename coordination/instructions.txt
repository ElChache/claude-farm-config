## Workflow Overview

### Step 1: You Start
1. Create `HUMAN_PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md` with your project vision

### Step 2: Product Owner (Phase 1-3)
1. **Phase 1**: Reads your document, asks clarifying questions via `PRODUCT_CLARIFICATIONS.md` (XML format)
2. **Phase 2**: Creates comprehensive `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md` 
3. **Phase 3**: Monitors team and provides product guidance

### Step 3: System Architect 
1. Creates technical architecture in `coordination/agent_output/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Creates implementation plan in `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`  
3. Creates all TASKS files with feature-level tickets
4. Monitors progress and reports every 5 minutes

### Step 4: Lead Developer
1. Creates development standards and environment setup
2. Reviews and refines all TASKS files
3. Supervises development team with reality checks
4. Reports progress every 5 minutes

### Step 5: Development Teams
1. Work on assigned tasks in their respective TASKS files
2. Break down large tasks into sub-tasks as needed
3. Communicate via FORUM.md and TASKS files

## Key Principles

### The Three Adults in the Room
- **Product Owner**: Maintains product quality and user focus
- **System Architect**: Ensures technical reality and architecture compliance  
- **Lead Developer**: Verifies everything actually works ("adult in the room")

### Communication Frequencies  
- **System Architect**: Checks BLOCKERS.md every 5 minutes, reports every 5 minutes
- **Product Owner**: Checks all channels every 5 minutes  
- **Lead Developer**: Monitors TASKS every 5 minutes, reports every 5 minutes
- **Product Owner Phase 1**: Checks PRODUCT_CLARIFICATIONS.md every 1 minute

### Document Completion Marker
All coordination documents must end with "DOCUMENT COMPLETE" when finished

### Release Structure
PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md uses release headers:
- # Release 1.0 Project Specification
- # Release 2.0 Project Specification (future)

## Getting Started

1. **You**: Create `HUMAN_PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md` with your project idea
2. **Run Product Owner**: They'll start Phase 1 and begin asking clarifying questions
3. **Monitor**: Check `PRODUCT_CLARIFICATIONS.md` for their questions and respond
4. **Continue**: The system will flow through all phases automatically

The coordination system handles the rest!
