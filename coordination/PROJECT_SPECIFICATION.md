# Monitors! - Project Specification

## Project Overview

**Monitors!** is an AI-powered monitoring application that enables users to create natural language monitors for tracking facts, conditions, and changes in real-time. The system leverages advanced AI to understand user intents, validate prompts, and evaluate complex conditions without requiring users to write code or configure complex rules.

## Core Concept

Users can create monitors using simple natural language like:
- "Tesla stock is under $500"
- "It's going to rain in San Francisco tomorrow"
- "Bitcoin has increased by more than 10% in the last week"
- "My website is responding slower than 2 seconds"

The AI system intelligently:
- Validates and improves user prompts
- Classifies prompts into fact monitoring vs change detection
- Extracts key information and evaluation logic
- Performs regular evaluations and sends notifications
