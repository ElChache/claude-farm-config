# AI Visual Testing Specification

## Revolutionary Concept
AI agents have "eyes" - they can see their work through screenshots and verify functionality visually.

## Split Documentation

### Release 1.0: Basic Visual Testing
See `coordination/AI_VISUAL_TESTING_BASIC.md` for:
- Screenshot capture and analysis
- Basic interaction (click, fill, navigate)  
- Environment isolation and port management
- Development workflow integration

### Future: Interactive Navigation  
See `coordination/AI_VISUAL_TESTING_INTERACTIVE.md` for:
- Full AI-driven user flows
- Complex multi-step navigation
- Goal-oriented automation
- Advanced error recovery

## Role-Specific Integration
Each development role has visual testing integrated into their workflow - see individual role files for specific testing requirements.

## Technical Foundation
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Each agent works in separate environment
- **Port Management**: Deterministic port assignment prevents conflicts
- **Screenshot Analysis**: Claude's native vision capabilities
- **Agent ID Coordination**: Unique naming prevents file conflicts

This system transforms development from blind coding to visually-guided development with AI oversight.
