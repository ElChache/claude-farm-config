# Product Clarifications - Release 1.0

## Strategic Questions for Human Project Owner

<question id="1" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>The HUMAN_PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md mentions "hard-coded email whitelist for limited beta users (50-100 users)" - do you have a specific list of beta user emails ready, or should we implement a system where you can add emails through an admin interface?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>I will provide complete list, but for now start with [dcerezoi@pm.me, davidcerezoinigo@gmail.com]. Implement system where I can add emails through admin interface.</text>

<question id="2" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the "Datadog of Real Life" positioning - are there any specific competitor products or services you want us to explicitly differentiate from beyond the ones mentioned (IFTTT, Zapier)? Any particular competitive advantages you want emphasized?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>The "Datadog of Real Life" positioning is perfect. Emphasize the AI-powered natural language understanding and the sophisticated temporal logic separation as key differentiators. No additional competitors beyond IFTTT/Zapier needed.</text>

<question id="3" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>The specification mentions AI provider abstraction with Claude as primary and OpenAI as fallback. Do you have existing API keys/accounts for both services, or will this require human intervention for account setup?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Not yet - will require human intervention for account setup. I'll need to create accounts and provide API keys.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="4" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For email notifications, do you want a specific "from" address/domain name (like "noreply@yourdomain.com"), or is generic email delivery acceptable for Release 1.0? This affects whether we need domain/email service setup.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Generic email delivery is acceptable for Release 1.0. Use whatever email service is easiest to integrate (SendGrid, etc.) with a generic from address. We can enhance branding later.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="5" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>The temporal logic innovation with historical data storage - are there any specific data retention policies you want (e.g., keep historical data for X months)? This impacts database design and storage costs.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>1 year data retention policy. Keep all historical data for 1 year, then archive or delete older data to manage storage costs.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="6" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the "monitors" branding - is there a specific product name you prefer, or should we proceed with "Monitors!" as the application name? This affects UI copy and branding throughout.</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Proceed with "Monitors!" as the application name. This branding works well.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="7" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>I misread the specification - let me ask correctly: What constitutes "success" for a monitor from a user experience perspective? Should we measure success by: (A) Monitor creation completing without errors, (B) First evaluation working correctly with data found, or (C) User receiving useful notification that helps them take action?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Answer is C - User receiving useful notification that helps them take action. Success is when the whole experience for the user is complete: they create a monitor, the system evaluates it correctly, and they receive an actionable email notification. The first action we are implementing is email notifications.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="8" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For Release 1.0 scope - you mention "no usage limits" for monitors per user. Are there any reasonable upper bounds we should implement to prevent system abuse (e.g., max 100 monitors per user), or truly unlimited?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>10 monitors per user for now, with rate limiting to prevent abuse. We can increase limits later based on system performance and user feedback.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

## Additional Clarifications Based on Human Interest

<question id="9" status="answered">
  <from>Human</from>
  <text>I'm particularly interested in the AI agent coordination system working properly. Are there any specific monitoring or reporting features you want to track how well the AI agents are coordinating and delivering quality work?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Yes, the coordination system itself is fascinating. Make sure we have good visibility into agent performance, task completion rates, and quality of deliverables. The Lead Developer "reality checking" is crucial.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="10" status="answered">
  <from>Human</from>
  <text>Given the sophistication of this coordination protocol, should we consider making the agent coordination system itself a feature or product offering in the future?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>That's an intriguing possibility but let's focus on making the Monitors! product excellent first. The coordination system is our competitive advantage in development speed and quality.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

## Additional Product Owner Questions

<question id="11" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For monitor evaluation frequency - should users have any visibility or control over how often their monitors are checked? For example, can a user see "This monitor was last checked 2 hours ago" or request a manual refresh?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Yes, absolutely. Users should have both visibility and control. Show "Last checked: X minutes ago" and provide a manual refresh button. Users need transparency about when their monitors were last evaluated.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="12" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the portal website vs main app split - should there be any analytics or usage tracking to help understand user behavior patterns, or should we focus on pure functionality for Release 1.0?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Analytics and usage tracking for user behavior is very valuable information for Release 1.0. Implement comprehensive user behavior tracking to understand how users interact with the application.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="13" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>When a monitor fails to evaluate (data source unavailable, AI error, etc.) - what should the user experience be? Should they get error notifications, see failed status in dashboard, or handle silently with retry logic?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Users should see the errors for Release 1.0. However, this should be a switch we can turn on and off. Implement visible error states in the dashboard with detailed error information, but make this configurable for future releases.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="14" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>For the visual data representation - the spec mentions cards for current state and charts for historical change monitors. Should users be able to customize these views (chart types, date ranges, etc.) or keep it simple with predetermined visualizations?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Keep predetermined visualizations for Release 1.0. Customization (chart types, date ranges, etc.) can be added in the next release. Focus on getting the core functionality right first.</text>
  </answer>
</question>

<question id="15" status="answered">
  <from>PM</from>
  <text>Should there be any onboarding experience for new users to help them understand the difference between "current state" and "historical change" monitors, or assume users will learn through trial and experience?</text>
  <answer>
    <from>Human</from>
    <text>Let's have a very nice introductory, optional, unobtrusive tutorial - I think they call this NUX (New User Experience). Users should be able to skip it but it should help them understand the core concepts.</text>
