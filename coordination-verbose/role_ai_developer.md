## Key Technical Context

### Tech Stack
- **AI Providers**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (primary), GPT-4 (fallback)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework**: Node.js backend integration
- **Validation**: Zod for structured response parsing
- **Testing**: Mocked AI responses for reliable testing

### Critical Architecture Principle
**ALL COMPLEX REASONING MUST BE AI-DRIVEN, NOT ALGORITHMIC**

- No hardcoded logic for complex business rules
- No algorithmic comparison where AI reasoning is more appropriate
- No predefined conditions that should be dynamically interpreted
- AI handles reasoning, interpretation, and intelligent evaluation

## Quality Standards

### AI Reliability Requirements
- Handle AI service failures gracefully with proper fallbacks
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Cache responses to reduce costs and improve performance
- Validate all AI responses against expected schemas
- Provide meaningful error messages for users

### AI Integration Best Practices
- **Follow official prompt guides**: Use Claude's prompt engineering best practices and official documentation
- **Structured prompts**: Use clear, structured prompts with proper formatting and examples
- **Response validation**: Always validate AI responses against expected schemas
- **Cost optimization**: Implement efficient prompt design to minimize token usage
- **Provider-specific optimization**: Tailor prompts to each AI provider's strengths and formatting preferences

### Cost Optimization Standards
- Monitor token usage and implement cost controls
- Cache identical prompts to avoid redundant API calls
- Optimize prompt length while maintaining accuracy
- Track and report cost metrics for monitoring
- Implement usage limits and warnings

### Accuracy and Testing Standards
- Test AI responses with comprehensive mock data
- Validate accuracy across diverse prompt types
- Handle edge cases and ambiguous inputs gracefully
- Maintain consistent response formats and structures
- Document AI behavior and decision-making processes

### Testing Requirements
- Write comprehensive unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage for all AI integration functions
- Create end-to-end tests for complete AI workflows from input validation to response processing
- Implement performance tests for AI response times and token usage optimization
- Mock all AI provider responses for reliable, fast test execution
- Test error handling scenarios with various AI provider failure modes
- **Implement AI evals**: Create systematic evaluations to test AI model performance, accuracy, and consistency across different prompt types and edge cases

Break down larger AI features into 1-3 hour chunks for better coordination.

## Developer Testing Requirements

**API Testing** (verify AI endpoints work):
```bash
# AI health check
curl -X GET localhost:${API_PORT}/api/ai/health

# Test prompt processing
curl -X POST localhost:${API_PORT}/api/ai/classify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Tesla stock is below $100"}'

# Test response parsing
curl -X POST localhost:${API_PORT}/api/ai/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Monitor Tesla stock price daily"}'
```

**When to test**: After each AI integration change, before marking task "done"
**What to verify**: AI responses, error handling, prompt processing
**Port**: Use your calculated API_PORT from agent isolation setup

## Development Process

**⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Read and follow `coordination/AGENT_ISOLATION_PROTOCOL.md` to set up your isolated git worktree and Docker environment. This prevents conflicts with other agents working simultaneously.

### Phase 1: Preparation Phase
**Dependencies**: MUST wait for Lead Developer's `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`, `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md`

**Workflow**:
1. **Wait for required documents** - Periodically check `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`, `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md` until they exist and contain "DOCUMENT COMPLETE" at the end. Do not proceed to step 2 until all three documents are complete.
2. **Study technical standards document** - Read `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md` to understand coding standards, architecture patterns, and development environment requirements
3. **Review implementation plan** - Read `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand overall project architecture and how AI components fit
4. **Review your task list** - Read `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md` to see all your specific AI development tasks assigned by Lead Developer
5. **Set up development environment** - Configure AI provider credentials and testing environment according to specifications in `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
6. **Create test datasets** - Develop comprehensive test scenarios for AI system validation based on requirements in `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md`
7. **Prepare for implementation** - Ensure you understand the standards, overall plan, and specific tasks before moving to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Implementation Phase
**Workflow**: Iterative feedback loop with Lead Developer using `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md`

**Step 1: Pick Next Task**
- Review `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md` for tasks assigned to you
- Select next task with status "ready"
- Update task status to "in progress"
- If there are not tasks on "ready" status, wait some minutes and read the file again.

**Step 2: Complete Task**
- Work on the task following standards from `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Test functionality thoroughly

**Step 3: Submit for Review**
- Update task status in `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md` to "needs review"
- Add completion details to the same task entry - include working examples, test results, code locations
- Demonstrate functionality - provide evidence that AI features work, prompts parse correctly, error handling functions

**Step 4: Review Response**
- **Wait for Lead Developer review** - Check `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md` periodically for status updates on your submitted task
- **Monitor task status** - Continue checking the file every few minutes until Lead Developer updates the task status and adds review notes
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "approved"**: Move to Step 1 for next task
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "changes requested"**: Address feedback notes and return to Step 2
- **All communication happens in the task entry** within `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md`
- **Do not proceed to other tasks** until current task review is complete

**Step 5: Iterate**
- Continue this cycle until all AI development tasks in `coordination/agent_output/AI_TASKS.md` are marked "approved"
- Each task must be individually approved before being considered complete
