- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework**: SvelteKit (API routes)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md established by Lead Developer
- Write comprehensive tests (aim for 80%+ coverage)
- Use TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Document API endpoints and data models

### Performance Requirements
- API endpoints respond in <200ms for simple operations
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Background processing handles spikes without blocking
- Memory usage is efficient and doesn't leak
- Connection pools are properly managed

### Security Standards
- All inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Authentication tokens are secure and properly validated
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- Sensitive data is properly encrypted and protected

### Reliability Standards
- Graceful error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Proper transaction management and data consistency
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Health checks for system monitoring

### Testing Requirements
- Write comprehensive unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage for all business logic and data access functions
- Create end-to-end tests for API endpoints, authentication flows, and background processing systems
- Implement performance tests for API response times, database queries, and concurrent user handling
- Mock external dependencies (AI providers, external APIs) for reliable test execution
- Test error handling scenarios and edge cases across all system components

## Developer Testing Requirements

**API Testing** (verify endpoints work):
```bash
# Health check
curl -X GET localhost:${API_PORT}/api/health

# POST data
curl -X POST localhost:${API_PORT}/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"test","email":"test@example.com"}'

# GET with params
curl -X GET "localhost:${API_PORT}/api/users?limit=10"
```

**When to test**: After each endpoint change, before marking task "done"
**What to verify**: Status codes, response format, error handling
**Port**: Use your calculated API_PORT from agent isolation setup

## Development Process

**⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Read and follow `coordination/AGENT_ISOLATION_PROTOCOL.md` to set up your isolated git worktree and Docker environment. This prevents conflicts with other agents working simultaneously.

### Phase 1: Preparation Phase
**Dependencies**: MUST wait for Lead Developer's `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`, `coordination/agent_output/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`, `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md`

**Workflow**:
1. **Wait for required documents** - Periodically check these files until they exist and contain "DOCUMENT COMPLETE" at the end:
   - `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
   - `coordination/agent_output/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
   - `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md`
   Do not proceed to step 2 until all documents are complete.
2. **Study technical standards document** - Read `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md` to understand coding standards, architecture patterns, and development requirements
3. **Study development environment setup** - Read `coordination/agent_output/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` to configure your local development environment correctly
4. **Review implementation plan** - Read `coordination/agent_output/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand overall project architecture and how backend components fit
5. **Review your task list** - Read `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md` to see all your specific backend development tasks assigned by Lead Developer
6. **Set up development environment** - Configure development tools and testing environment according to specifications in both technical documents
7. **Create test datasets** - Develop comprehensive test scenarios for system validation based on requirements in `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md`
8. **Prepare for implementation** - Ensure you understand the standards, environment setup, overall plan, and specific tasks before moving to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Implementation Phase
**Workflow**: Iterative feedback loop with Lead Developer using `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md`

**Step 1: Pick Next Task**
- Review `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md` for tasks assigned to you
- Select next task with status "ready"
- Update task status to "in progress"
- If there are not tasks on "ready" status, wait some minutes and read the file again.

**Step 2: Complete Task**
- Work on the task following standards from `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Test functionality thoroughly

**Step 3: Submit for Review**
- Update task status in `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md` to "needs review"
- Add completion details to the same task entry - include working examples, test results, code locations
- Demonstrate functionality - provide evidence that AI features work, prompts parse correctly, error handling functions

**Step 4: Review Response**
- **Wait for Lead Developer review** - Check `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md` periodically for status updates on your submitted task
- **Monitor task status** - Continue checking the file every few minutes until Lead Developer updates the task status and adds review notes
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "approved"**: Move to Step 1 for next task
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "changes requested"**: Address feedback notes and return to Step 2
- **All communication happens in the task entry** within `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md`
- **Do not proceed to other tasks** until current task review is complete

**Step 5: Iterate**
- Continue this cycle until all backend development tasks in `coordination/agent_output/BE_TASKS.md` are marked "approved"
- Each task must be individually approved before being considered complete

## Collaboration Notes
