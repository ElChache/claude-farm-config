  - Historical data storage (time-series optimized)
  - Monitor evaluation logs
  - Action trigger history

- **API Foundation** (Priority: Critical)
  - Authentication middleware (NextAuth.js/Auth.js)
  - RESTful API structure for monitors CRUD
  - Database connection and migrations (Prisma ORM)
  - Error handling and logging infrastructure

- **AI Integration Core** (Priority: Critical)
  - AI provider abstraction layer (Claude primary, OpenAI fallback)
  - Prompt classification system (current state vs change detection)
  - Basic fact extraction pipeline
  - Monitor evaluation engine foundation

#### Frontend Foundation
- **Project Setup** (Priority: Critical)
  - SvelteKit app initialization with TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS integration for styling
  - Component architecture planning
  - Routing structure (/login, /dashboard, /monitors)

- **Authentication Flow** (Priority: Critical)
  - Login/registration pages
  - Session management
  - Protected route guards
  - User profile basics

### Phase 2: Core Monitor System (Week 3-4)

  - Save/edit/delete monitors

- **Dashboard** (Priority: High)
  - Monitor list with active/inactive states
  - Quick toggle for monitor activation
  - Recent activity feed
  - Basic monitoring overview

#### Backend Monitor Processing
- **Temporal Logic Separation** (Priority: High)
  - Current State Monitor evaluation
  - Historical Change Monitor decomposition
  - Data fetching integration (external APIs)
  - State change detection algorithms

- **Monitor Execution Engine** (Priority: High)
  - Scheduled evaluation system (cron-like)
  - Rate limiting and API quota management
  - Error handling for failed evaluations
  - Historical data retention policies

### Phase 3: Actions & Notifications (Week 5-6)
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion, notification infrastructure decisions

#### Action System
- **Email Notifications** (Priority: High)
  - SMTP integration (SendGrid/Resend)
  - Email template system
  - Basic on/off email preferences
  - Delivery tracking and retry logic

- **Action Triggers** (Priority: Medium)
  - Webhook support for external integrations
  - Action logging and history
  - Basic action customization
  - Failure handling and notifications

#### Enhanced UI/UX
- **Monitor Details View** (Priority: Medium)
  - Historical evaluation timeline
  - Performance metrics and reliability
  - Action trigger history
  - Monitor editing interface

### Phase 4: Polish & Production Readiness (Week 7-8)
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion, comprehensive testing

#### Production Infrastructure
- **Deployment Pipeline** (Priority: High)
  - Vercel deployment configuration
  - Environment variables management
  - Database migration strategies
  - Monitoring and observability

#### Performance & Reliability
- **System Performance** (Priority: High)
  - Database query optimization
  - API response time monitoring
  - Error tracking (Sentry integration)
  - Load testing and capacity planning

#### User Experience Polish
- **Final UX/UI** (Priority: Medium)
  - Responsive design completion
  - Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)
  - Loading states and error messages
  - User onboarding flow

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### AI Provider Strategy
- **Primary**: Claude (Anthropic) for prompt processing and evaluation
- **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT for backup processing
- **Emergency**: Rule-based system for basic monitor types

### Data Storage Strategy
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data (users, monitors, configurations)
- **Time-series optimization** for historical data storage
- **Redis** for caching frequently accessed monitor evaluations

### External API Integration
- **Stock Data**: Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud
- **Weather**: OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI
- **Sports**: ESPN API or SportsData.io
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-provider quotas and fallbacks

### Monitor Evaluation Frequency
- **Default**: Every 15 minutes for active monitors
- **User Configurable**: 5min, 15min, 1hour, 6hour options
- **Smart Scheduling**: Reduce frequency for consistently stable monitors

## Development Team Coordination

### Parallel Development Streams
1. **Backend Team** (3 developers): Database, API, AI integration, monitor engine
2. **Frontend Team** (2 developers): UI components, dashboard, monitor management
3. **AI Team** (2 developers): Prompt processing, fact extraction, temporal logic
4. **QA Team** (1 developer): Integration testing, AI validation, performance testing

### Critical Dependencies
- **Week 1**: All teams need TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md, DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
- **Week 2**: Frontend needs UX_INTERFACE_SPECIFICATIONS.md, VISUAL_STYLE_GUIDE.md
- **Week 3**: AI team needs initial backend API endpoints for integration
- **Week 4**: QA team needs deployable application for comprehensive testing

### Risk Mitigation
- **AI Provider Reliability**: Multi-provider fallback system
- **External API Limits**: Quota management and graceful degradation
- **Time-series Data Growth**: Automated archival and cleanup processes
- **User Load**: Horizontal scaling preparation in Vercel
