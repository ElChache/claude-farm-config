# Technical Standards

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled
- No implicit any
- Strict null checks
- Unused locals and parameters detection enabled

### Code Formatting
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas where valid
- Line width: 100 characters

### Linting Rules
- ESLint with TypeScript support
- SvelteKit-specific rules
- No console.log statements in production code
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- AI Visual Testing for UI components (screenshot-based validation)

### AI Visual Testing Integration
All UI components must be tested using AI-powered visual analysis:
- Playwright screenshot capture
- Screenshots saved to `/tmp/screenshot_${agentId}_${timestamp}.png`
- AI analysis of UI compliance and functionality
- Integration with role-based testing workflows

## Development Workflow

### Git Standards
- Branch naming: `{agent_id}_work` for agent isolation
- Commit message format: `[TYPE] Description of changes`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Pull request required for all changes
- Lead Developer approval required before merge

### Code Review Process
1. Developer completes feature/fix in isolated environment
2. Creates PR with descriptive title and body
3. Lead Developer reviews code quality, functionality, and compliance
4. PR approved and merged, or changes requested
5. Only after successful merge is task marked as "lead developer review passed"

### Testing Before Merge
- All tests must pass locally
- Linting must pass without warnings
- Type checking must pass without errors
- Manual testing of affected functionality required

## SvelteKit Best Practices

### Component Organization
- Components in `src/lib/components/`
- Utilities in `src/lib/utils/`
- Stores in `src/lib/stores/`
- Types in `src/lib/types/`

### State Management
- Svelte stores for global state
- Local component state for UI state
- Avoid prop drilling - use stores for deeply nested data

### Route Organization
- Feature-based routing structure
- Load functions for data fetching
- Error pages for all routes
- Proper SEO meta tags

### Performance Guidelines
- Lazy load components where appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Use SvelteKit's built-in optimizations
- Monitor bundle size

## Database Standards

### Schema Design
- Use Prisma for schema management
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for columns)
- Proper indexes for query performance
- Foreign key constraints enforced

### Query Optimization
- Use prepared statements
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Monitor query performance

### Migration Management
- All schema changes through migrations
- Never modify existing migrations
- Test migrations on sample data
- Backup before major schema changes

## API Design Standards

### RESTful Principles
- Consistent URL patterns
- Proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Standardized error response format
- API versioning strategy

### Request/Response Format
```typescript
// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {...},
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "details": {...}
  }
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure token storage and refresh
- Rate limiting implementation

## AI Integration Standards

### Provider Abstraction
- Unified interface for all AI providers (Claude, OpenAI)
- Graceful fallback between providers
- Cost tracking and optimization
- Response format standardization

### Prompt Engineering
- Consistent prompt templates
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output parsing and error handling
- Cost-effective token usage

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error capture
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback strategies for AI failures
- Monitoring and alerting

## Security Standards

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use Zod for runtime type validation
- Prevent SQL injection
- XSS protection

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Secure API endpoints
- Environment variable protection
- Regular security audits

### Rate Limiting
- API rate limiting per user
- Abuse prevention mechanisms
- Cost control for AI usage
- Performance protection

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Type definitions for complex objects
- README files for major features
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### Process Documentation
- Development setup instructions
- Deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting guides
- Architecture decisions recorded

## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- User activity monitoring
- AI usage and cost tracking

### Development Metrics
- Test coverage reporting
- Build time optimization
- Code quality metrics
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Deployment Standards

### Build Process
- Automated testing pipeline
- Type checking in CI/CD
- Bundle optimization
- Environment-specific configuration

### Vercel Deployment
- Environment variable management
- Database connection pooling
- CDN optimization
- Performance monitoring

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No linting errors
- Security scan passed
- Performance benchmarks met
